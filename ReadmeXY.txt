XYplorer
--------
  XYplorer is a multi-tabbed dual pane file manager for Windows, 
  featuring a powerful file search, a versatile preview, a highly 
  customizable interface, and a large array of unique ways to 
  efficiently automate frequently recurring tasks. It's extremely
  fast and light, it's innovative, and it's fun!


Installation
------------
  XYplorer is portable. It doesn't require any "installation" in the 
  proper sense, and using it does not change your system or registry.
  You can run it directly from your USB drive, and you can have as many 
  parallel "installations" as you wish.

  Choose one of the following packages:
    (1) Installer Package
    (2) No-Install Package

  Note: No matter which package you use, Install or No-Install, running 
  XYplorer does not change your system or registry at any time.
 

Installation using the Installer Package
----------------------------------------
  Use this package to use an installer to install XYplorer, with icons 
  in the start menu and an uninstaller.
  
  Extract xyplorer_full.zip to some temporary directory and run 
  the included XYplorer_?.??_Install.exe.
  
  The following files are installed to the directory you 
  selected/created during the install procedure:

    XYplorer.exe ......... Application
    XYcopy.exe ........... Copy Handler
    ContextMenu64.exe .... Context Menu Handler
    XYplorer.chm ......... Help
    Startup.ini	.......... Sets the Application Data Path
    XYplorer Homepage.url  Link to www.xyplorer.com
    LicenseXY.txt ........ XYplorer License Agreement
    ReadmeXY.txt ......... Readme (this file)
    CatalogDefault.dat ... Sample Catalog File
    Uninstall.exe ........ Uninstaller

  Optionally a program group "XYplorer" is created under "Programs" 
  in your Start menu, containing four icons. You have a choice here:
  * Install for anyone using this computer (Default)
    > The program group is created for all users.
  * Install just for me
    > The program group is created just for you.

  The file Startup.ini contains information about the Application Data 
  Path. By default this path is set to %appdata%\XYplorer which on a 
  typical system (with English locale) is resolved to C:\Documents and 
  Settings\<user>\Application Data\XYplorer.

  The total size of all installed files will be about 7 MB.
  No further files are added anywhere to your system, and nothing 
  will be put into the registry but uninstall information.

  To uninstall the program click the "Uninstall" icon in the
  program group created during installation.

  How to Upgrade: Install over the current directory of XYplorer. Your 
  INI file will not be overwritten, so your settings and personal 
  license key remain intact.


Installation using the No-Install Package
-----------------------------------------
  Use this package to install XYplorer on a removable drive (e.g. USB), 
  or in any folder on any drive you like. All application data will be 
  stored under the application path.
  
  Simply extract xyplorer_full_noinstall.zip anywhere.


Finally
-------
  Read, understand, and accept LicenseXY.txt, the XYplorer License 
  Agreement. Start working.


Dependencies
------------
  
  * VB6 Runtime Files
    xyplorer_full.zip does NOT contain the VB6 runtime files needed to 
    run XYplorer. This is to keep download times short, and because they 
    are present on almost every computer.
    
    If you are not sure whether you got those files, it's easy to find out:
    If you can start XYplorer.exe you got them, if not you have to get them.

    ONLY IF THE PROGRAM DOES NOT START:
      The VB6 runtime files needed can be found at this URL:
        http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyId=7B9BA261-7A9C-43E7-9117-F673077FFB3C&displaylang=en
      Download the self-extracting file that installs the latest 
      versions of the Microsoft Visual Basic runtime files that all 
      applications created with Visual Basic 6.0 need in order to run.
